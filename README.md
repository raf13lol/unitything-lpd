# LPD

> What the hell is an "LPD"?

LPD is *well...*, it was a wip parody of LSD: Dream Emulator, however i have no more motivation

This has a *nearly* finished recreation of the moveset iirc, been a while since i've checked this

i'm uploading this just so it Exists and not lost as i think the moveset recreation wasn't actually so bad

.gitignore from some place on github
